The HIGH PRIESTESS is a retrospective of works that have been remastered for this project. The album has been carefully scored to mirror the experience of birth and rebirth. The compositions are welcoming enough to invite the newborn, powerful enough to hold the intensity of delivery, and evocative enough to be useful for breathwork.
