_Robert
Ã†OLUS Myers _is a composer,
performer and producer best known for his cinematic soundscapes incorporating
flute, synthesizer, and percussion. These works utilizing western classical and
indigenous compositional stylings draw readily from Asian, Arabic, and African
influences. He has composed four albums---_AEOLIAN MELODIES _and _RAYS _, released by Global Pacific Records and THE MAGICIAN and HIGH
PRIESTESS as independent releases.

Robert has participated in devotional music for over 40 years. He has played harmonium and sung the Cosmic Chants of Yogananda for Self Realization services, drummed for Sufi Dhikrs, played flute and percussion for the Mevlevi Turn, and was a long time inner circle musician for the Dances of Universal Peace as led by [Yakzan Hugo Valdez][0].  Most recently Robert has been playing in support of kirtan wallahs.
